## Content maanagment
Dynamic content management is carried out through the platform's built-in databases. The databases are built using a classic records and categories schema. Records can belong to multiple categories or not use categories at all. The number of databases is unlimited.

Content can be both displayed from the database and saved into the database using input fields in the application.

Be sure to specify a unique identifier for this database. It will be used to access the database from the application and via the REST API.

## Custom fields
The database contains default fields. If these fields are insufficient, you can add an unlimited number of custom fields.

Each field must have a name (for display in the list) and its **api_name** for operating it via the REST API or from the application. 

## Categories
To manage Categories, select database and go to the **Categories** tab.

Categories can be nested within each other. To create a nested category, click the **+** button on the desired category.
If you need to create a top-level category, click **"Create Category"** in the top-right corner of the form.

## Posts
The list of posts follows a traditional block-system structure, including a title, description, full description, and image. Additional fields can also be displayed within a post and filled in if needed.
