## **General Overview**
**Moxly RestAPI** provides an interface for managing users, system settings, and database content via HTTP requests. All requests require authentication using a Bearer Token.

## 📝 **Notes**
- `Authorization: Bearer <SECRET_TOKEN>` must be included in all requests.  
- Some operations require the `secret` parameter for additional security.
