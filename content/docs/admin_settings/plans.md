# Pricing plan configuration

## Plans

Up to 4 pricing plans can be configured.

The total number of pricing plans can be unlimited, but no more than 4 can be active at a time. The remaining plans will be archived.  

A pricing plan can only be deleted if it is not in use. If at least one user is assigned to the plan, it cannot be deleted.

If the price is set to 0 for both periods, it is considered a free plan.
