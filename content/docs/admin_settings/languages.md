# Languages and translations

The system offers automatic translation management. The number of translations can be unlimited. Translations are added through the admin panel. Translations can be edited if necessary. And previously added ones can be deleted.


## Default language

By default, English is used, but it can always be changed in the settings, and any of the added languages can be set as the default language.

## Adding language
An additional language can be added through the admin panel. To do this, you need to specify the language name, its two-letter code, and upload a flag icon.
