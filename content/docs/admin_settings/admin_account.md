## Default account
**Immediately after installation**, the first thing (for security reasons) is to change the data of the default account of the platform administrator.

Default data after installation: login admin@admin.com password: admin.

And so, to replace the data with your own, go to the My Profile page by clicking on the icon next to the Name on the left in the site header.
