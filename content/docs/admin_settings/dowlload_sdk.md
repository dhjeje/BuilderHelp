We recommend installing libraries via NPM â€“ this ensures using the latest versions of these libraries.

The installation process may take some time. To ensure the installation works properly, you need to configure Cron (see Cron setup in the Installation section).

## Logs
All installers write their own logs. Additionally, the platform itself maintains a log.  

If any errors or unusual behavior occur, these logs can help identify the cause. This is mainly useful for developers to fix issues in future versions.
